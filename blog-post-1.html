            In the late 17th century, a seismic shift occurred in the human understanding of nature and thought itself.
            On nearly opposite sides of Europe, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently unveiled calculus.
            Calculus offered a language to describe everything from falling apples to planetary orbits, with implications
            reaching far beyond physics. At the same time, Leibniz’s pursuit of a characteristic universalis, a universal
            symbolic language, hinted at an even deeper dream: to mechanize reasoning itself. His binary notation, inspired
            by I Ching, laid down the conceptual scaffolding for digital logic centuries ahead of its time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Enlightenment that followed was fueled by such visions. With nature now expressible in elegant equations
            and universal laws, thinkers imagined a deterministic universe, humming like clockwork. Rationalism was both
            a metaphysics and a technology: knowledge could be built, piece by piece, like gears in a machine. The mind,
            too, was seen as a kind of mechanism, capable of being understood, and perhaps even replicated. Philosophers
            like Descartes and Leibniz speculated about automata—mechanical beings that could mimic human thought and behavior.
            These ideas planted the seeds for later developments in computation and artificial intelligence.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the early 19th century, Joseph-Marie Jacquard revolutionized textile production with a loom that used punched
            cards to “program” patterns. What Jacquard wove wasn’t just fabric, it was logic, embedded into machinery. Charles
            Babbage, inspired by Jacquard’s innovation, envisioned a “thinking” engine: a mechanical computer capable of performing
            complex calculations automatically. His Difference Engine and later the Analytical Engine, although never fully realized,
            anticipated modular architecture, memory storage, and even conditional branching.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Into this intellectual lineage stepped Ada Lovelace, who grasped what Babbage’s machine could do. In her annotations to
            Menabrea’s paper, she conceptualized the first algorithm, thus becoming the prophet of programmable abstraction.
            Nearly a century later, Alan Turing's Turing machine, a conceptual device stripped to its essence, proved the limits
            and possibilities of mechanical computation. Turing formalized the idea of algorithmic logic and laid the theoretical
            groundwork for artificial intelligence.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Running parallel was the rise of Boolean algebra, introduced by George Boole. His insight was sublime in its simplicity: that
            logic could be modeled mathematically, with propositions behaving like equations. By assigning binary values to truth
            (true = 1, false = 0), Boole unknowingly gave future engineers the toolkit for every logic gate, every microprocessor, and
            every decision tree inside your computer today. Together, these thinkers forged the intellectual DNA of modern computing.</p>
