        <h1>Romantic Vision and Poetic Imagination</h1>
        <p class="blog-date">August 22, 2025</p>
        <p>Where the Enlightenment sought clarity, certainty, and systems, Romanticism rebelled.
            Romanticism was a cry for wholeness, against the cold, mechanical determinism of rationalism; it offered the storm of human
            emotion, the abyss of the soul, the flicker of divine mystery.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>We begin with William Blake, the mythopoeic prophet whose Songs of Innocence and Experience and epic works like Jerusalem and
            The Marriage of Heaven and Hell forged their own cosmogony. Blake's symbolic pantheon, Urizen, Orc, Los, and others, was an
            alternative spiritual system, a private mythology rebuking Newtonian mechanism and moral orthodoxy alike. He saw industrial
            materialism as a narrowing of human perception, “the mind-forged manacles” that enslaved imagination.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Next comes Samuel Taylor Coleridge, whose poetic genius bloomed from dreams, metaphysics, and laudanum-laced inner voyages.
            In works like Kubla Khan and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Coleridge explored what he called “psychological romance”, a
            landscape where dream logic governs and memory collides with myth. His prose writings in Biographia Literaria also laid early
            groundwork for literary theory and the aesthetics of the sublime. Through his fragmented imagery and opiate-induced reveries,
            we glimpse imagination as both a creative force and a haunting mirror.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>We then descend into the psyche of Lord Byron, whose persona became as iconic as his verse. The Byronic hero, proud, melancholic,
            rebellious, was a psychological archetype shaped by his own tormented charisma. In Manfred and Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage,
            Byron transforms the sublime into existential solitude, articulating inner darkness with startling modernity. In Darkness,
            the world itself becomes a metaphor for his haunted interiority: a sunless void where humanity flickers between despair and
            fire-fed denial. He is Romanticism’s Prometheus: defiant, wounded, and unrepentant.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, We pass through the prism of T.S. Eliot, the great modernist inheritor of Romantic fracture. In The Waste Land,
            Eliot gathers the broken myths of the past, layering voices and fragments in a collage of cultural exhaustion. If Blake
            and Byron invoked personal myths, Eliot sifts the ashes of shared ones. In Burnt Norton, he confronts the paradox of time
            as psychic presence. “Time present and time past / Are both perhaps present in time future,” he writes, tracing memory and
            meaning through a still point of dislocation. His poetics of dislocation and tradition marks the psychic shift from Romantic
            individuality to modern alienation. What emerges is a new kind of myth-making, an attempt to map the ruins of meaning.
