        <h1>Structure, Sound, and Form in Classical Music</h1>

            Music, like mathematics, unveils a hidden architecture beneath experience, one that transcends language while obeying
            its own intricate logic. Nowhere is this interplay between structure and expression more exquisite than in the classical
            tradition of music. We chart the evolution of musical form and feeling from the symmetry of the Baroque to the depths of the Romantic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Beginning with Johann Sebastian Bach, a master of fugue and counterpoint. His compositions, particularly the Well-Tempered Clavier
            and the Art of Fugue, represent music as a formal language: layered, recursive, and rule-bound, yet endlessly inventive. Each voice
            in a fugue is like a line of thought, distinct but interwoven into a harmonious logic. Bach’s music is our gateway to understanding
            music as both expression and mathematical code.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>From formalism to mysticism, we move to Giuseppe Tartini, whose famed “Devil’s Trill Sonata” sits at the crossroads of virtuosity and vision.
            Tartini reportedly dreamt of the Devil playing beside his bed, the piece a recollection of that spectral encounter. Beyond its technical brilliance,
            the sonata introduces music’s uncanny power: how it can channel dream, metaphor, and metaphysical awe. Here, we consider the violin as an oracle. </p>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Next, we encounter the clean gleam of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose music stands in luminous contrast to what followed. His symphonies and concertos
            exemplify formal clarity and balance, the Classical ideal rendered in graceful arcs and perfectly weighted phrases. Yet within that precision lies depth:
            ambivalence, laughter, and quiet tragedy breathe through his clean lines.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Then comes the storm: Ludwig van Beethoven, heir to Mozart, but revolutionary in tone. Where Mozart’s structures comforted, Beethoven’s Eroica and Late Quartets
            break and remake form. He drags music into struggle, melodic development as emotional catharsis. In Beethoven, storm replaces symmetry, and personal vision eclipses
            inherited norms.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, we enter the hushed corridors of Franz Schubert, whose Lieder and symphonies give voice to interiority. His music is not about twilight, introspective,
            melancholic, and tenderly broken. In Schubert, Romanticism takes a new turn: it turns inward. Phrases wander, and themes do not resolve; they dissolve into longing.
            Through his subtle modulation and harmonic daring, we hear the birth of emotional ambiguity as compositional logic.
