    <h1>About</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        The TEP Cipher Translator is an independent, community-built tool created by solvers, for solvers, with no official affiliation to The End Project (TEP) beyond a shared fascination with its puzzles. Designed to support those navigating the cryptic terrain of TEP, the site offers a suite of utilities tailored to the decoding challenges frequently encountered in the project.

Core features include a growing library of encryption and decryption methods commonly used in TEP clues, a video steganography tool that analyzes frames and extracts least significant bits (LSB), and a curated collection of cryptography resources, including links to courses, external tools, and learning materials. The platform also hosts a blog that reflects on the symbolic, thematic, and technical dimensions uncovered during the solving process.
